# Arp-8
MIDI-to-CV arpeggiator

The Arp-8 is a MIDI to CV converter that can arpeggiate, syncing with either a MIDI clock, analog clock (+5v pulse), or
internal clock. The arpeggiation can be turned off to act as a simple single voice MIDI to CV converter.

Installing firmware

When installing the new firmware, be sure to have a cable inserted into the "CLK" jack.
